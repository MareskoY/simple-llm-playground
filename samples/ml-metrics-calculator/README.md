# ML Metrics Calculator

This project demonstrates how to calculate key metrics for model accuracy: MAE, MAPI, and R² using Node.js.

## Key Metrics

1. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average absolute deviation of predictions from true values.
2. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Measures the average absolute percentage deviation of predictions from true values.
3. **R² (R-squared)**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.

## How to Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start-ml-metrics`
